                    Once in a lifetime experiences should be for everyone. For
                    the average person, traveling to another state can already
                    be a tall task let alone another country or around the
                    world. As the tourism industry bounces back and grows, we
                    believe travel should be accessible to everyone. Others may
                    want to keep it as a fantasy or believe it's something only
                    wealthy or retired people can do. Fuck that. We're here to
                    see everyone experience the world.

                  <p>
                    With over a decade facilitating experiences around the world
                    & generations in the travel industry, we are pioneering
                    travel in Web3. While others just look to make a profit &
                    the rest want to keep it out of reach, we're a group of
                    passionate travelers that wants to connect the world. Our
                    philosophy is simple: Traveling will change your life.

                    JetGetter Club was founded to build the best travel
                    community in Web3 & our NFTs will give you access to some of
                    the best experiences in the world. Bond with others over
                    your passion to see the world and be put on to things you
                    never knew of before. This is not some cookie cutter shit
                    either, the way we see travel is about exploring cultures &
                    places to the fullest not just tourist attractions (though
                    those are still fun). When our Mint Sells out, we will be
                    sending 20 people on a trip to one of our partnered
                    destinations. <br />

                    There is one thing we know for sure, more people need to
                    travel and more people need to be invested into crypto. Our
                    goal is to help onboard in both ways while we catch vibes
                    together. Life is about balance and doing the things that
                    you love, even if you don't travel if you believe in that
                    ethos, you're in the right place.

                    Simply put, you're a dope individual that knows how to enjoy
                    life. You're a tastemaker. You're open minded. You want to
                    experience the most you can in this life. You like good
                    food. You like to learn about other cultures & you use all
                    these things to shape your perspective in life. Lastly, you
                    understand the balance between wealth and enjoying the
                    fruits of your labor & if you're none of these things but
                    want to learn, we're here to welcome you. <br />

                    Up until this point staking has been for a token that can be
                    redeemed for things. But what if we skipped that process?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We're going to test it. We had planned to give 20 people a
                    trip post mint, here's how we'll do it:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Two days after mint, those who want to qualify will stake &
                    lock up their jet for 24 days (If you want to unstake it
                    will be .24 SOL). After 24 days, 7 jets will be selected to
                    receive an airdrop of a 1/1 NFT designed by an artist we
                    hire. This NFT will be your booking confirmation, and the
                    destination will be in the metadata. Now you have some
                    decisions to make...
                    <br />
                    <br />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1. Keep your 1/1 NFT because you love the art (it will
                    always be redeemable)
                    <br />
                    2. Redeem your NFT for a trip & acquire a new NFT
                    <br />
                    3. Sell this NFT on the open market to someone that would
                    like the above options
                    <br />
                    <br />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This will be the first staking that only takes into account
                    the time you staked rather than the amount of tokens you
                    have. This isn't to say a token won't be coming, but we
                    think this can be a fun new way to reward our hodlers
                    immediately.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This process will be repeated until 20 NFTs backed by trips
                    are given out. Trips won‚Äôt be the only things backing NFTs
                    though.
                    <br />
                    <br /> What about the people that don‚Äôt get selected? All
                    good, we‚Äôll have plenty of opportunities to earn rewards and
                    we‚Äôll be able to see who has staked the longest even when
                    the 24 day snapshot is up.. <br />
                    <br />
                    If you buy our NFT on secondary while the 24 Day stake has
                    commenced, you can still stake right away. Our thinking here
                    is that we‚Äôll determine who the diamond hands are by the
                    number of total days staked & we‚Äôll have plenty for those
                    Diamond Jet Holders to come.

                    We understand that all inclusive vacation packages aren't
                    for everyone; trust me we're right there with you. Our 'All
                    inclusive' is more about ensuring you get an authentic
                    experience - not cheap liquor and prepaid food within a
                    resort. The destinations we have built itineraries for and
                    are partnered with are ones that take an extra level of
                    effort to prepare for your arrival. <br />
                    <br />
                    Not every destination needs to be all inclusive or planned
                    out so much in advance, that's why the destinations we are
                    partnered with are the ones where it is better to be more
                    prepared. Preparation and local knowledge is key when
                    visiting these countries, you don't want to show up and not
                    be able to do something. The logistics behind these
                    destinations matter a lot more. <br />
                    <br />
                    The bookings will be available to everyone in SOL, USD, &
                    $DUST with holders of our Jet NFT receiving exclusive
                    pricing. Currently we are exploring how to integrate these

                    We want to put more power into the hands of our tour guides
                    and drivers. These people are the ones making the experience
                    for the tourists and usually get taken advantage of by
                    different tour companies. We are our own tour company,
                    meaning our people get paid on time and get paid well for
                    the experiences they provide.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We are a US based company & in the US only 33% of people
                    have an active passport. We can only imagine what those
                    numbers could be around the world.

                    When it comes to an international trip, we know there can be
                    roadblocks like having the financial ability, getting time
                    off, or just the effort that goes into planning. Now we can
                    try to write your work a note but if you can get the time
                    off, we will solve #1 & #3. The other aspect here is being a
                    part of the Solana community as individuals for so long
                    we've loved seeing stories of people winning on their plays.
                    We want to provide you an opportunity to celebrate & reflect
                    on those wins without having to convert it. This is also an
                    opportunity to use strong alt coins from NFT projects within
                    the ecosystem!

                    The Jet Reserve is our treasury that will be used to grow
                    and expand this brand. It will be initially funded with a
                    percentage from mint. From there it will be sustained by
                    revenue from our bookings, percentages from our royalties
                    and more. Let's just say we'll be making minting fun again

                    We plan to explore having our own coin that can be used
                    within our ecosystem. Tokenomics have not been established
                    yet but the idea will be that you can use this coin for
                    bookings, raffles, and plenty more.

                    Seems to be on every roadmap nowadays & why not? If you're a
                    part of an incredible community and brand you want to rep it
                    properly in your life. Merch can be done, but we are more
                    interested in fashion & luxury pieces.

                        Our founder Maanz comes from a background in business
                        development in startup & tech companies but travel
                        changed his life. He's also explored independent
                        ventures in the music industry, ecommerce, and travel
                        industry ranging from social media influencer to
                        creating merchandise to booking shows. His successes and
                        failures along the way is what fuels this project. The
                        travel aspect is a family affair, generations of
                        experience in the industry has led to us being the
                        suppliers for the experiences we currently offer. The
                        destinations started with the mother land (India) and
                        expanded from there specifically to places that take an
                        extra effort to plan and be in tune with the culture.
                        These itineraries have been booked in web2 for over a
                        decade, Maanz plans to use web3 to inspire more people
                        to take trips that change your life.
