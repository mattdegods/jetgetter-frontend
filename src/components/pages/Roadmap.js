                  Once in a lifetime experiences should be for everyone. For the
                  average person, traveling to another state can already be a
                  tall task let alone another country or around the world. As
                  the tourism industry bounces back and grows, we believe travel
                  should be accessible to everyone. Others may want to keep it
                  as a fantasy or believe it's something only wealthy or retired
                  people can do. Fuck that. We're here to see everyone
                  experience the world.

                  With over a decade facilitating experiences around the world &
                  generations in the travel industry, we are pioneering travel
                  in Web3. While others just look to make a profit & the rest
                  want to keep it out of reach, we're a group of passionate
                  travelers that wants to connect the world. Our philosophy is
                  simple: Traveling will change your life.

                  credit card perks & shit. Your NFT is an exclusive access pass
                  to a growing brand & community in this space, one that will

                  JetGetter Club was founded to build the best travel community
                  in Web3 & our NFTs will give you access to some of the best
                  experiences in the world. Bond with others over your passion
                  to see the world and be put on to things you never knew of
                  before. This is not some cookie cutter shit either, the way we
                  see travel is about exploring cultures & places to the fullest
                  not just tourist attractions (though those are still fun).
                  When our Mint Sells out, we will be sending 20 people on a
                  trip to one of our partnered destinations. <br />

                  There is one thing we know for sure, more people need to
                  travel and more people need to be invested into crypto. Our
                  goal is to help onboard in both ways while we catch vibes
                  together. Life is about balance and doing the things that you
                  love, even if you don't travel if you believe in that ethos,
                  you're in the right place.

                  experience the most you can in this life. You like good food.
                  You like to learn about other cultures & you use all these
                  things to shape your perspective in life. Lastly, you
                  understand the balance between wealth and enjoying the fruits
                  of your labor & if you're none of these things but want to
