                  Once in a lifetime experiences should be for everyone. For the
                  average person, traveling to another state can already be a
                  tall task let alone another country or around the world. As
                  the tourism industry bounces back and grows, we believe travel
                  should be accessible to everyone. Others may want to keep it
                  as a fantasy or believe it's something only wealthy or retired
                  people can do. Fuck that. We're here to see everyone
                  experience the world.

                  With over a decade facilitating experiences around the world &
                  generations in the travel industry, we are pioneering travel
                  in Web3. While others just look to make a profit & the rest
                  want to keep it out of reach, we're a group of passionate
                  travelers that wants to connect the world. Our philosophy is
                  simple: Traveling will change your life.

                  JetGetter Club was founded to build the best travel community
                  in Web3 & our NFTs will give you access to some of the best
                  experiences in the world. Bond with others over your passion
                  to see the world and be put on to things you never knew of
                  before. This is not some cookie cutter shit either, the way we
                  see travel is about exploring cultures & places to the fullest
                  not just tourist attractions (though those are still fun).
                  When our Mint Sells out, we will be sending 20 people on a
                  trip to one of our partnered destinations. <br />

                  There is one thing we know for sure, more people need to
                  travel and more people need to be invested into crypto. Our
                  goal is to help onboard in both ways while we catch vibes
                  together. Life is about balance and doing the things that you
                  love, even if you don't travel if you believe in that ethos,
                  you're in the right place.

                  experience the most you can in this life. You like good food.
                  You like to learn about other cultures & you use all these
                  things to shape your perspective in life. Lastly, you
                  understand the balance between wealth and enjoying the fruits
                  of your labor & if you're none of these things but want to

                      countries including India, Dubai, Greece, Maldives, and
                      Bhutan. What that mean is we already have partnerships
                      with airlines, hotels, drivers, and guides where we have
                      curated itineraries that are customizable based on your
                      interests upon your request. Our partnerships with
                      airlines for booking flights are currently only for those
                      flying out of the US but anyone international can still
                      take advantage of everything else in any of those
                      destinations. These trips are also perfect for NFT
                      communities to connect IRL as we can service up to a 500
                      person trip.

                  Up until this point staking has been for a token that can be
                  redeemed for things. But what if we skipped that process?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                  We're going to test it. We had planned to give 20 people a
                  trip post mint, here's how we'll do it:
                  <br />
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two days after mint, those who want to qualify will stake &
                  lock up their jet for 24 days (If you want to unstake it will
                  be .24 SOL). After 24 days, 7 jets will be selected to receive
                  an airdrop of a 1/1 NFT designed by an artist we hire. This
                  NFT will be your booking confirmation, and the destination
                  will be in the metadata. Now you have some decisions to
                  make...
                  <br />
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                  1. Keep your 1/1 NFT because you love the art (it will always
                  be redeemable)
                  <br />
                  2. Redeem your NFT for a trip & acquire a new NFT
                  <br />
                  3. Sell this NFT on the open market to someone that would like
                  the above options
                  <br />
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                  This will be the first staking that only takes into account
                  the time you staked rather than the amount of tokens you have.
                  This isn't to say a token won't be coming, but we think this
                  can be a fun new way to reward our hodlers immediately.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                  This process will be repeated until 20 NFTs backed by trips
                  are given out. Trips won‚Äôt be the only things backing NFTs
                  though. What about the people that don‚Äôt get selected? All
                  good, we‚Äôll have plenty of opportunities to earn rewards and
                  we‚Äôll be able to see who has staked the longest even when the
                  24 day snapshot is up.. If you buy our NFT on secondary while
                  the 24 Day stake has commenced, you can still stake right
                  away. Our thinking here is that we‚Äôll determine who the
                  diamond hands are by the number of total days staked & we‚Äôll
                  have plenty for those Diamond Jet Holders to come. Who needs a

                  partnered with are ones that take an extra level of effort to

                  the destinations we are partnered with are the ones where it
                  is better to be more prepared. Preparation and local knowledge
                  is key when visiting these countries, you don't want to show
                  up and not be able to do something. The logistics behind these
