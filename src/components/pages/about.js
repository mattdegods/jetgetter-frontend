                    Once in a lifetime experiences should be for everyone. For
                    the average person, traveling to another state can already
                    be a tall task let alone another country or around the
                    world. As the tourism industry bounces back and grows, we
                    believe travel should be accessible to everyone. Others may
                    want to keep it as a fantasy or believe it's something only
                    wealthy or retired people can do. Fuck that. We're here to
                    see everyone experience the world.

                    With over a decade facilitating experiences around the world
                    & generations in the travel industry, we are pioneering
                    travel in Web3. While others just look to make a profit &
                    the rest want to keep it out of reach, we're a group of
                    passionate travelers that wants to connect the world. Our
                    philosophy is simple: Traveling will change your life.

                    JetGetter Club was founded to build the best travel
                    community in Web3 & our NFTs will give you access to some of
                    the best experiences in the world. Bond with others over
                    your passion to see the world and be put on to things you
                    never knew of before. This is not some cookie cutter shit
                    either, the way we see travel is about exploring cultures &
                    places to the fullest not just tourist attractions (though
                    those are still fun). When our Mint Sells out, we will be
                    sending 20 people on a trip to one of our partnered
                    destinations. <br />

                    There is one thing we know for sure, more people need to
                    travel and more people need to be invested into crypto. Our
                    goal is to help onboard in both ways while we catch vibes
                    together. Life is about balance and doing the things that
                    you love, even if you don't travel if you believe in that
                    ethos, you're in the right place.

                    life. You're a tastemaker. You're open minded. You want to
                    experience the most you can in this life. You like good
                    food. You like to learn about other cultures & you use all
                    these things to shape your perspective in life. Lastly, you
                    understand the balance between wealth and enjoying the
                    fruits of your labor & if you're none of these things but

                          changed his life. He's also explored independent
                          ventures in the music industry, ecommerce, and travel
                          industry ranging from social media influencer to

                          Matt is our lead dev and self-proclaimed biggest fan.
                          He started out in the engineering world working a
                          stale government job and is now a full-time Web3 dev,
                          working with the likes of DeGods, Mickey DeGods, and,
                          of course, us. He's traveled internationally a few
                          times but is inspired through this project to push
                          further outside of his comfort zone and see the world.
