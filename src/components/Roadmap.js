            <h2>Introduction üõ¨</h2>
            <p>
              Once in a lifetime experiences should be for everyone. For the
              average person, traveling to another state can already be a tall
              task let alone another country or around the world. As the tourism
              industry bounces back and grows, we believe it should be
              accessible to everyone. Others may want to keep it as a fantasy,
              keep it as something only the "wealthy" can do or the "retired".
              Fuck that, we‚Äôre here to see everyone experience the world.
              <br /><br />
              With over a decade facilitating experiences around the world &
              generations in the travel industry, we are pioneering travel in
              Web3. While others just look to make a profit & the rest want to
              keep it out of reach, we're a group of passionate travelers that
              just want to share with other passionate travelers. Our philosophy
              is simple: Traveling will change your life.
              <br /><br />
              This is NOT an investment opportunity, moon play, passive income,
              or nothing like that. Think of it as replacing travel credit card
              perks & shit. Your NFT is an exclusive access pass to a growing
              brand & community in this space, one that will reward its holders,
              provide value to the ecosystem, and have everyone enjoying life
              while we do it.

              accessible & build the dopest travel community in the world.

            <h2>Why JetGetter? üõ©</h2>
            <p>
              We welcome all PFPs & Normies.
              <br /><br />
              JetGetter Club was founded to build the best travel community in
              Web3 & our NFTs will give you access to some of the best
              experiences in the world. Bond with others over your passion to
              see the world and be put on to things you never knew of before.
              This is not some cookie cutter shit either, the way we see travel
              is about exploring cultures & places to the fullest not just
              tourist attractions (Though those are still fun). When our Mint
              Sells out, we will be sending 20 people on a trip to one of our
              partnered destinations.
              <br /><br />
              There is one thing we know forsure, more people need to travel and
              more people need to be invested into crypto. Our goal is to help
              onboard in both ways while we catch vibes together. Life is about
              balance and doing the things that you love, even if you don‚Äôt
              travel if you believe in that ethos, you‚Äôre in the right place.

            <h2>What are we building? üß±</h2>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  1. Community: Our community will be the ‚ÄúTravel Influencer‚Äù
                  but the most authentic one you‚Äôve come across. People coming
                  together to share their experiences with others, learn from
                  one another, form bonds that may lead to taking trips
                  together, meetups when you‚Äôre in each others cities, and just
                  an overall place to have fun around our similar interests.<br /><br />
                </li>
                <li>
                  2. Media: How do we showcase our community as the tastemakers
                  of Web3? We build & use our platform to showcase our expertise
                  by providing quality travel content that is authentic &
                  informative. We‚Äôll be looking for video editors & quality
                  content created to be featured on various social media pages.
                  This is an opportunity for us to create partnerships, reward &
                  showcase members of our community, bring some realness to the
                  travel industry and grow the overall brand. Aside from
                  creating content, there has been a rising desire from our
                  community to put all the info we share in discord in a
                  consolidated way. Post mint we‚Äôll explore building a social
                  media like platform to have all the information easily
                  accessible.<br /><br />
                </li>
                <li>
                  3. Travel: This is the alpha you‚Äôve been waiting for. We are
                  suppliers of full vacation packages in a number of countries
                  (India, Dubai, Greece, Maldives, Bhutan) to name them. What
                  that mean is we already have partnerships with airlines,
                  hotels, drivers, and guides where we have curated itineraries
                  that are customizable based on your interests/request. As far
                  as the airlines, it is currently only for those flying out of
                  the US but anyone international can still take advantage of
                  everything else in any of those destinations. These trips are
                  also perfect for NFT communities to connect IRL as we can
                  service up to a 500 person trip.<br /><br />
