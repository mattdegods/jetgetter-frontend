Notes/Ideas:
- Cut out the windows on the airplane lounge (transparent) and i'll overlay
a video on a loop of clouds going by 0.0
- Is there anything BELOW the header page or is it simply for navigation 
to the Roadmap and othe pages?
- What if we added a blueprint on the table in the middle and it was selectable?
- The blueprint could be glowing and the user could click on it to take them to
the blueprint page, where the fun begins:

- Jet model centered on page with blocks of roadmap info on either side
- Need to find some open source packages for the scrolling effect
- Do I want to convert this to NextJS for paging and performance improvements?
